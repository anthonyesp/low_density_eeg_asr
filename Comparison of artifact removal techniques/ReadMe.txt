Requirements in MATLAB:
 - EEGLAB toolbox (https://eeglab.org/others/EEGLAB_References.html)
 - EEGLAB's plugins:
 	- clean_rawdata (https://github.com/sccn/clean_rawdata)
 	- ICLabel (https://github.com/sccn/ICLabel)
 - boundedline repository (https://github.com/kakearney/boundedline-pkg/)

How to run the code as described in the paper:
 1. Open "main.m" in MATLAB.
 2. Edit the path strings to locate EEGLAB and boundedline directories.
 3. Edit the part string to locate the data.
 4. Hit "Run" and take your time, it'll be a long journey...
